# Shape-changing architecture 
In this project we set out to explore how shape-changing architecture can make outdoor spaces useable in changing weather. The prototype for the concept was a round shape-changing structure with two modes of input: user controlled, and context aware (adjusting to wind direction).

### Prototype
Since the materials were expensive only parts of the concept were built. Linear actuators were used to drive the laser cutted cog wheel system. A user manual controller was made with potentiometer-knobs that mapped to a window each. A weather vane with a custom made potentiometer was made to have the structure react to the wind direction. The system was controlled through an Arduino.
